# raman_plotter

Some special code I wrote for Jon to make plots from his data.

## How to use:

Step 1) Download the code from Github using the green button above. Use `Download ZIP`.  

Step 2) Put that ZIP folder wherever you are going to use it and unzip it.  

Step 3) Put the data you want to analyze in this general folder.  

Step 4) Click on the `raman_plots.Rmd` file.

Step 5) Run all the chunks up until `Directories and Files` section.

Step 6) In line 69 replace `"raman_plot.png"` with what you would like the plot to be called. Run this chunk and each chunk as you go along.

Step 7) In line 76 replace `"input_data"` with the file path to your data that you placed in Step 3.

Step 8) Make sure the `input_df` printed out at line 118 makes sense with the data you've supplied.

Step 9) Continue running each chunk, looking that the data is being set up as you want and expect.

Step 10) Once you get to the plotting adjust as needed and its hard for me to make instructions for this specific as I do not know what you want.
